fix M25P05/M25P10/M25P20/M25P40/M25P80 detection of first generation chips.
chiplist update.
///

2.2.0.0
///
bug fix: ICE25P05, AMIC A25L05 to A25L16 detection.
Added Spare size value for SPI NANDs in chiplist and add corresponding _IC_Spare variable in scripts.
No CRC calculation in scripts.
CRC calculation in buffer Menu.
Scripts update.
chiplist, added Zetta, FMD, XTX manufacturers.
Added M93S46, M93S56, M93S66, ER5911, ER5912, MSM16911, 93C57 support (special adapter required).
support "MultiDies" SPI Nor and SPI Nand (like WINBOND W25M512JV, W25Q01JV, W25M02GV...)
Programming time improvement of the SST old chips (time divided by 2.7 in worst case).
Possibility to Read and Write the spare area of spi NANDs.(for advanced users)
Better support of SPI and I2C F-RAMs (write speed = read speed, fast!).
ASUS .CAP files support, at opening binary files are analysed and converted to bin if necessary (not based on file extension).
Chip search improved, multicriteria by (chunk)name and voltage with * joker. ex: 25q*1.8 will list all xx25Qxxx with 1.8 volt 
Various improvements concerning interface and algorithms.
Access to help documents by right click on adapters and programmers.
Chiplist structure update, + added and fixed many references.
Possibility to see more CH341 based programmers like 'CH341 black' and 'CH341 green' with the of 3.3/5.0 volts  modifications, as well as the Chinese programmer with the positions reversed from the site https://skygz.taobao.com, (others under request).
note: chiplist is no more editable, an import in data base can be done anyway (see document in chiplist.zip).
